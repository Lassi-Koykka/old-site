        <p>
          I'm a dedicated and self-motivated programming hobbyist and
          ICT-student originally from Tampere Finland. I thoroughly enjoy
          problem-solving and challenging myself. On my spare time, I often like
          to work on all kinds of personal projects (including this website) and
          study new technologies so I can play with them and see what I can come
          up with. Most of these projects can be found listed on my GitHub
          account. I'm a quick learner and I'm interested in how things actually
          operate under the hood.
