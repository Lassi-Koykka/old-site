            I'm a dedicated and self-motivated programming hobbyist and
            ICT-student originally from Tampere Finland. I thoroughly enjoy
            problem-solving and challenging myself. On my spare time, I often
            like to work on all kinds of personal projects (including this
            website) and study new technologies so I can play with them and see
            what I can come up with. Most of these projects can be found listed
            on my GitHub account. I'm a quick learner and I'm interested in how
            things actually operate under the hood.
